## continuation customization

I want a way to config the -go tools to continue in such a way that a claude / vocl session continues on a codex / voco session, and a codex / voco session continues on a claude / vocl session.

I want to be able to turn continuation on and off. 

I want to be able to customize the continuation prompt.

I want to be able to customize the continuation notification, and the audio ("say") notification should be cross-platform. 

Most importantly, I want to be able to customize the Terminal app in which the tool continues. For that, first write a series of intelligent queries that you can ask to search tools for how you can start sessions on different platforms (OSes), and in different terminals (not just iTerm). 

## docs

Make sure the package has an extensive documentation in the `docs` folder, which should be realized as a Jekyll site for Github Pages with the just-the-docs/just-the-docs remote Jekyll theme. 

## killing old sessions

Currently the -go continuation sessions open subsequent tabs in the same Terminal app, and the old sessions that has stopped remains dormant but running. Somehow, intelligently, Iâ€™d like the continuation to kill the old sessions intelligently. Not sure how. It would have to be done cross-platform.
