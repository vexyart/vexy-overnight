- Analyze @external/codex/codex4ever.py

Compare them to @src/vexy_overnight/hooks.py 

1. Our `hooks.py` implementation is ugly, as it contains a Python code inside a string. Instead, we should have dedicated @src/vexy_overnight/hooks_tpl folder and in there we should have "hook templates", basically Python files with simple template insertions (possibly just for str.format) if needed. We should pass these files through some str.format if needed when installing the hook. 

2. But the main pain point is that our "simple" `hooks.py` implementation of the hooks is, well, TOO SIMPLE. 

`claude4ever.py` and `codex4ever.py` go through some hoops to actually start a new terminal tab and run the continuation in that new tab. This is because the continuation is started from within the running claude or codex instance. With our simplistic hooks.py implementation, the continuation runs only when I manually stop the original instance.

So the trick is that `claude` CLI or `codex` CLI is running, it has completed some task, and then it "silently" calls the hook which is our Python tool we’ve installed. The Python tool gets executed in a "headless" way. It needs to "spawn" a new session of claude or codex IN A TERMINAL (ideally in a configurable terminal app like Terminal.app or iTerm.app on macOS, and on Windows Terminal or some other popular terminal in Windows).

I see that this works: 

```
open -a Terminal $(which codex)
```

but this: 

```
open -a Terminal $(which codex) 'Say hello'
```

doesn’t. But this is exactly what I’d need to use (pass some additional params). 

Our installation script should write into `$HOME/.codex/voco-new.py` something like: 

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['codex', 'Say hello'])
```

(Well, actually the thing that needs to be called).

and then our `$HOME/.codex/voco-go.py` tool on macOS would call `open -a Terminal "$HOME/.codex/voco-new.py"` or `open -a iTerm "$HOME/.codex/voco-new.py"`

And something similar should be done for Windows. And something similar should be done for claude :)
